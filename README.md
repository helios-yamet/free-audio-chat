- **Tech Stack**
  - [x] Use Elixir/Phoenix to rewrite the backend code
  - [x] Use Recat/Next.js to rewrite the frontend code

- **Infra**
  - [x] ~~Use docker to deploy to PaaS platform like [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [Fly](https://fly.io/)~~ 
  - [x] Use GitHub Actions + AWS Lightsail to deploy backend server
  - [x] Backend service cluster, auto scaling, load balancing, etc.
    - Backend service use Elixir libcluster to build cluster
    - Frontend app use the client load balance strategy
    - [x] [TURN cluster scale](https://github.com/membraneframework/membrane_ice_plugin/issues/20)
      - Fix by start turn before the libcluster, still wait the upstream library to fix it normally
  - [ ] Security enhancement, like coturn TLS setup, end-to-end encryption, etc.
    - [ ] TURN enable TLS
  - [ ] Privacy enhancement.
  - [ ] IPV6 support.
