  "faq": {
    "q1": "Q: Why did you guys build this?",
    "a1": "Offline interactions are quick and easy; we built free4.chat with no registration or login requirements, to try and replicate that feeling online.",
    "q2": "Q: Does free4.chat support video?",
    "a2": "No. We always feel drained by videochat, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1255648721309626369\">we‚Äôre not the only ones</a>. Until we have truly great VR, videochat is an uncomfortable ‚Äúuncanny valley‚Äù‚Äîwe feel much more relaxed in audio-only chat, and as an added bonus it‚Äôs much easier on mobile device‚Äôs battery life!",
    "q3": "Q: What browsers do we support?",
    "a3": "All modern browsers, including mobile! It may not work well when opened inside other apps (WeChat e.g.) so please open it in an actual browser.",
    "q4": "Q: How many people can be in one room?",
    "a4": "There‚Äôs no hard limit, but we‚Äôve had rooms with over 100 people that still had great audio quality! free4.chat works great for both small groups and big crowds. ",
    "q5": "Q: What can I do with Mornin?",
    "a5": "Our team uses it for online meetings, and for gaming together. Some more creative uses we‚Äôve heard: online concert, ASMR experiences, live podcasts.",
    "q6": "Q: How private are free4.chat rooms?",
    "a6": "The random URL means your room is highly unlikely to be found by anyone you don‚Äôt share the link with. The privacy of a free4.chat room at the protocol level is roughly the same as other popular services (Zoom, Google etc.) We‚Äôre huge privacy advocates and would love to add end-to-end encryption, but haven‚Äôt found a solution that will work well in browsers for large groups. ",
    "q7": "Q: Can you password-protect a free4.chat room?",
    "a7": "Not at the moment‚Äîonly people you share a link with can find your free4.chat room, but we‚Äôre exploring the idea of password protected rooms for the near future.",
    "q8": "Q: What is free4.chat made with?",
    "a8": "free4.chat is made with <a href=\"https://nuxtjs.org\"/>NUXT</a> and <a href=\"https://pion.ly/\">Pion</a>. Check out the source code of <a href=\"https://github.com/fox-one/mornin.fm\">the website</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mixinnetwork/kraken\">service</a>",
    "q9": "Q: Who are you folks?",
    "a9": "We‚Äôre the team behind <a href=\"https://mixin.one\">Mixin</a> (a decentralized crypto messenger) and <a href=\"https://fox.one\">Fox.ONE</a> (a decentralized exchange), and we‚Äôre huge proponents of privacy and freedom."
